### What is a Convetional Commit?
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
### Why use Convetional Commit
1. Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
2. Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
3. Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.
