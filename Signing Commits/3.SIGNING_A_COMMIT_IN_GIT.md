# Signing a commit in git

The first thing we must do is set up the key in our local device, it is important to make this configuration in our personal computer.

Also we need the id of the key, if you're following this guide, at the end of the previous step the key id is provided, but you can check it out again listing the keys again with the command `gpg --list-keys`.

Our id is the last 16 characters of the key that starts with `sec`.

Once we have ready pur key id, wich we refer as `id_key`, the first command we use is:
```
git config --global user.signingkey id_key
```
This will associate the selected key with Git in our computer.

Finally to sign a commit with our unique key, use:
```
git commit -S 
```
In order to avoid the `-S` flag every time we make a commit, we can configure git to sign automatically with>
```
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
