The **Git index** is a **staging area** between the **working directory and repository.** 

It is used to build up a set of changes that you want to **commit together**. *To better understand the Git index, then first understand the working directory and repository.*

You can check what is in the index by the **git status** command.

                            $ git status

|*Command* | *Description*| 
|--------|--------|
|    **git status**    |    ![](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-index-output.png)    |


In conclusion, the **git status command** allows you to see which **files** are **staged**, **modified but not yet staged, and completely untracked.** Staged files mean, it is currently in the index.
